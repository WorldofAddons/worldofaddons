## Why?
Managing WoW Addons manually:
- You need to keep track of files, versions, and updates yourself
- Tedious if you use a lot of addons

Curse/Twitch Client:
- Bloated and buggy
- Has Ads and user tracking
- Closed source
- Addon selection limited to the Curse library

World of Addons is an alternative WoW addon management client that keeps the user in control.
Our system is open source, simple, and thoroughly tested.
Just copy & paste an addon's URL from your browser into World of Addons and hit enter!
 [Wiki: How to Install a New Addon](https://github.com/WorldofAddons/worldofaddons/wiki/How-to-Use-World-of-Addons#how-to-install-a-new-addon)

## How?
1. User browses [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons) or [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/addons.php) and finds an addon they want to install.
2. User pastes the addon's URL into World of Addons and hits "Enter".
3. WoA reads the addon's author and version information from the website.
4. User confirms the addon and clicks "Install".
5. WoA downloads the addon directly from the website and keeps track of files and versions.

World of Addons checks for updates by repeating step 3. If a new version is available, updating is just one click.

World of Addons **does not** re-host addons on our own servers; we don't need or have any.
